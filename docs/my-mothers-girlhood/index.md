# Preface

<p style="text-align:center">By Nancy Stone Clark</p>

The following story was written by Nancy Stone Clark who married Dr. Jacob Lansing Van Deusen on December 26, 1808. He was the great-great grandfather of E. Herbert Van Deusen. It's a story of her parents Sanford and Arabella Gale Clark as told to her by her mother. It includes what life was like for them in the early 1800s; how she met Dr. Jacob Lansing Van Deusen; the start of the First Dutch Church in Kingston, NY; their friends DeWitt Clinton and Aaron Burr; and the invention of the first steamboat Clermont by Fulton with its first trip from New York City to Albany, NY.

# My Mother's Girlhood

It was a balmy June day when we - mother, sister Marie, and I - were sitting on the porch, a porch half hidden with jasmine and honeysuckle. The family was a large one at the time consequently quiet hours were extremely rare in the Montague homestead. But on that charming day we were alone. I can see my mother still, as I saw her then, sitting on a low chair, softly humming a familiar air. A white mull kerchief was drawn loosely over her shoulders, and her cap - very becoming to her - was of the same fine material.

"Mother," said I, "this is a favorable opportunity for you to tell us how you spent your youthful days. Heretofore you have given us only fragmentary reminiscences. The time may come when it would be a pleasure for your descendants to be informed how you spent your girlhood. And it may be Maria's or mine in coming years to impart that information."

Instantly my mother appeared to be looking back across the half-forgotten years. But in a few minutes after, the vision of them all seemed to flash upon her, and she said, while plucking a spray of honeysuckle:

> "My youthful days were not eventful ones, but I will begin at the beginning of them, and tell you, as well as I can recollect, how I spent them, at least, many of them.
>
> I was born in Albany, New York, on the twenty-ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord 1791. The house in which we lived was one of those spacious ones with a high-ridged but low-sloping roof, built in the style of the early Dutch settlers, with the gable towards the street. The parlors were on one side of the long, broad hall, and directly opposite the parlors there were two large rooms wherein my father transacted his business. The lawn in the rear of the house was a green, shady place full of trees, shrubs, dwarf box, vines, and beautiful flowers, filling the air with their sweet perfume.
>
> We, Katherine, John and I, were young when we were left motherless. Our father rarely mentioned our mother's name to us after she was taken from us. When he did mention her name, the tears invariably filled his eyes.
>
> Dinah, on the contrary, greatly enjoyed talking about her. Many and many a time she said to me:
>
> > 'Miss Nancy, you were too young to remember very much about your mother. Among seventy thousand women you wouldn't find one like her. You are a good child, Miss Nancy, and so is Miss Katharine, but neither one of you will ever be just like your mother in this wide world. You surely do take after her in some of your ways, and Miss Katharine is almost as saint-like. John, he has 'herited his mother's beautiful eyes. You take more after your father than either Miss Katharine or John, though I have nothing to say against your father, for he is looked up to by most everybody. But your blessed mother! Why, I heard Aaron Burr say that your mother, 'Madam Clark,' he called her, was the most queenly mannered lady he had ever known. I heard him say that with my own ears.'
>
> Having lost my mother at so early a period in my life, I could not realize how great a loss I had sustained. I still had my father, sister, and brother, besides Dinah and Cato. Dinah had always taken a great deal of care of us - my mother had never been strong. After she was taken from us, I thought we might live without our father, but I was not at all sure we could live without Dinah. Her devotion to my mother, and to her mother before her, never wavered. And to us she continued alike loyal and steadfast. In a word, she was well-nigh indispensable. She did for us just what she thought our mother would have wanted done. She even purchased all our clothing. Fortunately for us she was partial to delicate colors and simply made garments - very unlike the majority of her race in that respect. Consequently, we were always dressed in good taste. During the summer months we wore pretty flowered chintz gowns. The rest of the time we wore gowns of a soft woolen material called 'stuff.' Our large bonnets were adorned with one long white ostrich plume, and our pelisses were made of both light and heavy broadcloth. Every morning we put on a clean white linen apron, fastened over the shoulders with broad bands. Dinah called our aprons shorteldoecykers. We never succeeded in pronouncing that Dutch name for apron to Dinah's entire satisfaction. After vainly struggling with the long word, Dinah would say:
>
> 'Children, you don't seem to get the right twist of it.' An exception to our plain gowns was made on Sunday. On that day we wore a heavy brocaded silk gown, very short-waisted, with crimped linen cambric frills round the low neck and short sleeves, while the hem of the narrow skirt just touched the top of our prunella buskins, which were ornamented with silver buckles. John, too, wore crimped linen cambric frills round the sleeves and in the front of his brass-buttoned coat.
>
> Nothing but illness on Sunday morning prevented us from being seated in our high-backed pew fifteen minutes before the opening of the regular church service. During the fifteen minutes the clerk read a portion of Scripture, 'in order,' he said, 'to draw our minds from all worldly affairs.'
>
> My father was a lawyer, and he had an extensive practice. (He began his practice at Herkimer, on the Mohawk River.) While he thoroughly enjoyed his profession, still he deeply regretted that it prevented him in a measure from giving his family the attention he would have been pleased to give them. Now and then he would spend an evening reading to us, and my mother would add to the enjoyment by singing and playing on the harpsichord. Dear Katherine was the only one of us who inherited my mother's musical voice. Occasionally father would invite several of his associates in the parlor of an evening to partake of a cup of tea or coffee, with the ever-accompanying 'olykeek'. After our mother was taken from us, father wished me to assist in serving; and it was a pleasure for me to do so, because father's associates were exceptionally well-bred. I was greatly charmed, even from a little girl, with the elegant manners of Aaron Burr, who was a frequent guest. Many a cup of tea and coffee I poured for him. When father gave a dinner, I was not expected to serve, or even to be present. On those occasions Cato served.
>
> Father had a fine sense of propriety. We were most carefully guarded. Even when going to or returning from school a very short distance - either Dinah or Cato accompanied us. Speaking of school, I must tell you that school life was delightful to me. And I shall have to admit that I was far more fond of a book then I was of a needle. That, of itself, was a sore trial to Dinah, for she considered the skillful use of a needle greatly superior to any other accomplishment.
>
> She frequently said to me: 'Needles are useful, Miss Nancy, but the books you read so much does take a good deal of your time. Just look at Miss Katharine now! See how han'some she is learning to overhand, and she is ever so much younger than you.'
>
> While Dinah considered time unemployed in a measure when spent in reading, my father, on the contrary, encouraged me in my taste, and also John, but putting into our hands Shakespeare, Plutarch's Lives, Paradise Lost, Pilgrim's Progress, Young's Night Thoughts, Dryden, Pope, English and Roman history, and other works. True some of them were beyond our years, but in perusing them we imbibed a taste for good literature - so very essential in early years.
>
> Our daily life was a simple, wholesome, happy one. We had companions suitable to our age, companions carefully selected for us. We greatly enjoyed playing shuttlecock and battledore, also grace hoop. John, however, preferred quoits and tick-tack. Occasionally we would take a drive, or a sail on the Hudson River. When we did so, we had the pleasure of inviting some of our companions.
>
> But I must leave unmentioned many things which occurred during my girlhood, lest I weary you by the recital, and now tell you how the daily routine of my life was suddenly interrupted, when one morning father entered my room, and said, while tenderly stroking my hair:
>
> > 'My daughter, after a period of mature reflection, I have decided to part with you for one year. I desire to afford you a better opportunity for receiving instruction than you are at present receiving. I have just completed all necessary arrangements for you to attend a classical school at Goshen in this State, and where I propose sending (Katharine) and John when they reach a suitable age.'
>
> (In earlier years one of the preceptors of that school was Noah Webster, the celebrated lexicographer.)
>
> > 'That school is presided over by teachers not only of intelligence, but also of elegant manners. That information I received from some of your mother's kinspeople who now reside in Goshen, as you know. Your mother considered deportment exceedingly important. I will apprise Dinah and have her attend to the preparation of a suitable wardrobe for you. A period in your life has been reached, my daughter, when it will be a benefit to you to rely not only upon your own resources, but also to receive instruction from those who have had superior educational as well as social advantages. Thus far you have been a great comfort to me, and nothing could induce me to part with you, even for one year, if I did not firmly believe that you will be greatly benefited thereby. And I take pleasure in feeling assured that in the future, as in the past, I will have cause to thank the heavenly Father for giving me my beloved daughter Nancy.'
>
> At first I did not think I could go so far away from my father, sister, and brother. Then, Dinah and Cato were to be considered, too. But before many hours were passed, my heart was beating quickly over the prospect before me, for the love of change belongs to youth. And what a decided change would that one be because I had rarely been farther from home than Ballston Spa, where we all spent the summer months! Father thought the balsamic air there very delightful, and the mineral waters conducive to our health."

(Ballston Spa was then widely renowned as a summer resort until overshadowed by its near neighbor, Saratoga Springs.)

> "While I had been to Goshen several times with my mother when she visited her parents, Dr. John and Arabella Jones Gale, who resided there for many years, still I was too young to remember much about these visits. My going so far away from home greatly troubled Dinah and Cato - Cato kept watch and ward over our interests with almost as much solicitude as Dinah did. However, in less than twenty-four hours after, Dinah had several seamstresses engaged in making my clothing, and at the expiration of one week she informed me that my 'wardrobe was in proper order.' Father, being in the parlor at the time, picked up a newspaper from the table and read to me this advertisement, which, by the way, I happened to see this morning when I was in the garret looking over some old letters and legal documents in father's brass-nailed portmanteau."

So saying, my mother took out of her sewing basket a very small, thin newspaper, "The Albany Gazette," and read to sister Marie and me this advertisement, the same one her father had read to her in bygone years:

> New York & Albany Mail Stage, on the West side of Hudson's River, will commence running every day on the 25th inst. Leaving Albany at 6 o'clock A.M. The public are informed that this line is in excellent order, good houses for accommodation of Travelers, convenient carriages, good horses and careful drivers.
>
> For seats, apply to J. Wetmore, corner of Green & Beaver Streets, Albany, and to David Godwin, Vesey Street, New York, or to Wm. Williams, Hoboken.
>
> Fare through, eight dollars; five cents per mile for way passengers; 15 lb. baggage gratis; 150 lb. baggage the same as a passenger. The proprietors assure the public that nothing shall be wanting on their part, to render this route agreeable to the travelers.
>
> <p style="text-align:center">THE PROPRIETORS</p>
>
> N.B. The Proprietors not accountable for baggage unless particularly receipted for.
>
> Albany, 1806

> "After father had finished reading the advertisement," resumed my mother, "he said:
>
> > 'Daughter Nancy, I will now go to Mr. Wetmore's and engage seats for us in the mail stage. We will set out on our journey tomorrow morning. We will go direct to New York, because I have business to transact there, and I also wish to see several of my friends who reside in that city. After spending a week or ten days there, I will conduct you to your school at Goshen.'
>
> When I recall the pleasures of my life, continued my mother, I am inclined to think that I never spent three happier days, consecutively, than the three days I then spent sitting by my father's side in that mail stage while we were travelling from Albany to New York. Many of the public conveyances at that period were unwieldy and uncomfortable, the roads barely passable in places, and bridges almost unknown; nevertheless, the journey was one of deep interest and delight. The landscape along the Hudson River I thought very beautiful, exceptionally so in the vicinity of the Catskill Mountains.
>
> I am reminded - speaking of the Catskill Mountains - of a call we made at that time upon a friend of my father's, the Reverend George Doll, who was then preaching in the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in the village of Kingston, situated, as you well know, at the base of those grand and lofty mountains.
>
> The Reverend George Doll, 'domine,' my father called him, related to us many interesting circumstances and customs connected with that church, which, by-the-by, was an ancient one, even at that period, having been organized in the year of our Lord 1659.
>
> He informed us that in those early times, the church owned large tracts of land, 'glebes' he called them, which were rented to the surrounding farmers. The church-wardens collected the rents yearly. The rents were frequently paid in farm produce, game and peltry. These were sent to New Amsterdam, now New York, and sold for the benefit of the church. He informed us that the rents, one year, besides farm produce, included one hundred deer, fourteen wild cats, and thirty-two foxes.
>
> We were shown two quaintly enchased silver communion cups, presented by the Holland Church, one bearing the date 1683, the other one 1711.
>
> I timidly asked the privilege of holding them. And while I was admiring them, father said:
>
> > 'How precious and almost sacred these vessels must have been to the communicants in far-away days, too. An everpresent reminder that the mother church had not forgotten this daughter church, although separated by the great sea.'
>
> That village, Kingston, was burned by the British, you know, in the year of our Lord 1797, during the Revolutionary War, that event having occurred about twenty-nine years previous to our passing through Kingston while we were on our journey.
>
> I distinctly recollect the driver calling our attention to several places where nothing remained of former houses but broken walls - mute witnesses of that pitiful, disastrous conflagration.
>
> My father did not feel well the day we arrived in New York, and during the time we were there he was confined to the hotel and under a physician's care. He was greatly disappointed, not only that his illness prevented him from attending to some legal matters, but that it also prevented him from spending a few hours with Lukie, an aged colored man, who, for many years, in the early part of his life, was a faithful servant in his father's family. Besides, he could not accept invitations to take dinner with some of his friends while he was there. He regretted very much that he could not accept of DeWitt Clinton's invitation, for he and father were ardent friends, although I must admit that I had frequently heard sharp legal and political disputes between them on more than one occasion, in Albany. However, many of his friends called upon him, especially those with whom he had expected to dine; and some of their daughters contributed to my pleasure in the way of sight-seeing, drives, and two delightful sails, one on the East River and one on the North River. We also went to the Battery, or Battery Walk, as it was then called. I do not recollect the name of the hotel where we stayed, but it was not far from Trinity Church, on Broadway.
>
> When the physician gave us permission, we set out for Goshen in a stage-coach. Our journey thither was somewhat tedious and disagreeable from the fact that the roads were in a deplorable condition owing to heavy rains. But when we arrived at our destination we were received as cordially by the teachers and the pupils that we soon forgot all about the discomforts we had experienced while we were on our way.
>
> The instruction imparted, to the female pupils particularly, at that school, as I recall it, seems to me to have been intended to fit them more for social life than to acquire classical knowledge.
>
> While we had lessons in writing, arithmetic, grammar, music, and French, still, as was then considered far more important for us, we were taught needlework, taught to dance gracefully the slow but stately minuet, and, above all, manner - to be courteous, the grace of repose which gives power and charm to woman. A writer has said: 'Manner is more expressive than words.' Accordingly, it was daily, yes, hourly, impressed upon us that manner was the ultimatum of a finished education."

"Mother, what did you do on Saturdays?" Marie asked. "I know those days are sometimes very dull for a boarding scholar."

> "That was far from being my experience," mother responded. "An arrangement had been made by father and several of my kinsfolk living at Goshen, whereby I was to spend Saturdays and Sundays with them. I would have been pleased - and they also - if I could have made my home with them, but father thought such a plan would have a tendency to distract attention from my studies. Still, it gratified me very much that I could spend two days a week with them. I learned a great deal about my mother from them, particularly of her early life, that otherwise I never would have known, having lost her, as I have told you, when I was a young girl. They told me about many of her ancestors, too. (My mother was of English descent.)
>
> My kinsfolk at Goshen attended the St. James Episcopal Church, and while I was there I was confirmed in that church - the church of my mother. One great source of pleasure to me on Saturdays was reading and re-reading old letters, of which my kinsfolk had several packets - letters which they very highly prized. Many of them were more than one hundred years old, and had been most carefully preserved from one generation to another. I spent hours poring over them, dim and discolored by age as they were. I was especially interested in the ones which had been written by the DeLanceys, who were kinsfolk of my mother's family, the Jones.
>
> James Delancey, as you know, was Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of New York in the year of our Lord, 1753. Those letters were not only interesting but very instructive.
>
> My kinsfolk had also a small packet of letters written by Sir William Jones, - letters Sir William had written to his kinsfolk during the time he was Judge of the Supreme Court in Bengal, India. He was a very intelligent man, and also a great linguist, speaking and writing in more than twenty languages. For translating Hindu and Mohammedan books into English - books on Hindu and Mohammedan law, morals, religion, etc. - he was knighted by King George III. He was not only distinguished for learning, my kinsfolk told me, but also for his sincere piety.
>
> The Most Honorable East India Company erected a life-size statue to his memory in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, and a monument in Bengal, where he died.
>
> I supposed by mother must have known about these kinsfolk of hers, but to me it was all new. In perusing those letters I received a great deal of information. And they afforded me much pleasure, too, written, as they were, in the elegant and stately style of the time.
>
> I spoke to father afterwards about those kinsfolk of my mother's. He said she knew all about them. And not only so, but a steel engraving, a facsimile of the statue erected in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, had been sent to 'those living in America who were related to Sir William by blood,' was the wording. My kinsfolk at Goshen received one, and also my mother. That engraving was burned in a fire which destroyed the house and nearly all it contained.
>
> In the house at the time there was an old mahogany secretary, wherein, in a secret drawer, were valuable legal documents, old letters, and the engraving of the statue of Sir William. When a messenger was sent to inform one of our kinsmen of the burning of the house, he inquired, with the deepest solicitude in his voice, 'Was the old mahogany secretary saved?' 'No,' replied the messenger, 'but we saved your brand-new feather bed.'
>
> <h3 style="text-align:center">Part II</h3>
>
> I had been at school four weeks when I was informed that there was a man in the reception room inquiring for me. When I entered the room, Cato grasped my hand.
>
> > 'The Lord bless you, Miss Nancy!' he exclaimed. I was so glad to see him that I could not keep the tears back.
> >
> > 'I was certain that one or both of us would have to cry for joy,' he said, while wiping the great tears off his dusky face. 'Now, please, Miss Nancy, come out on the lawn and I'll show you something your father has sent you that you didn't 't all reckon on.'
>
> To my great surprise on the lawn stood my snow white pony. My delight was unbounded, and in less than ten minutes every one of the teachers and pupils were on the lawn admiring the gentle little creature.
>
> 'Oh,' I cried, 'I can take a teacher or a pupil every time I ride, for my father has sent the pillion, too!'
>
> The trustworthy pony was a source of great pleasure. The pupils - alphabetical order - took turns riding, and the kind but exceedingly dignified teachers frequently enjoyed a ride at a galloping pace.
>
> Father told me the day he left me at Goshen that he had made arrangements with a merchant in that village whereby I could procure the necessary materials I would require for embroidering at his store, and that when he returned to accompany me home he would settle the bill.
>
> Nearly every article I saw the pupils making, I, of course, wanted to make one like it. The result was that I had several articles of needle work on hand: samplers, bookmarks, needle-cases, silk and bead bags, frills, etc., nearly all of which were in an unfinished condition, because our teachers said they considered it a 'relief to our mind and nerves to have a number of articles in course of preparation.'
>
> When I wanted embroidery silk, crewels, cotton, or beads, I invariably took one of the pupils to the store with me. I rarely purchased for myself only. Some of the pupils were generally in need of the same, and I thoroughly enjoyed supplying their needs. And another consideration: it did not take any money, although one of the pupils told me that when twenty-five of her kinsfolk died she would have more land and more money than she would know what to do with, then she would purchase for me all the crewels and beads I wanted, in return for what I had purchased for her.
>
> Well, the time passed quickly at school, so quickly and so delightfully that when father returned to Goshen to accompany me home I could hardly realize that I had been there for so long a period.
>
> After father had paid all my bills, he said:
>
> > 'My daughter, I presume you have a great many articles which you have made and also have embroidered. Allow me to see your handiwork.'
>
> 'What shall I show him?' I said half aloud, while I slowly ascended the staircase and entered my room. The articles I would have been pleased to show him - although few in number were in an unfinished condition, owing to the rule of having several of them on hand at one time. Finally, I selected a very small needle-case into father's hand and did not speak. After he had examined it closely both on the outside and the inside, he said:
>
> > 'My daughter, there is evidently a want of proportion here. The bill I have just paid was much larger than this needle-case. True, this is a very handsome one as far as I am capable of judging, but the bill for it was more than one hundred dollars.'
>
> Could it be possible that I had purchased such a large amount of embroidering material, I thought, more than one hundred dollars worth!
>
> There was a painful silence for a few moments, then I hesitatingly said:
>
> 'I never thought about the bill. And - and I wished to - to give.' I could say no more, because the tears which I could not restrain rolled slowly down my cheeks. Father then put his arm around me, saying, as he did so:
>
> > 'We will think no more about this bill. Do not allow it to cause you a tear, my daughter. It is very evident that I have manifested a want of forethought. I must not allow you to grow up without the knowledge of the proper use and also the value of money. Hereafter you must assist in purchasing for the family. The experience will be a great benefit to you.'
>
> Father had brought Cato with him in order to take my pony back to our home in Albany.
>
> As the steamboat Clermont was to leave New York for Albany that month, October, in the year of our Lord, 1807, father said that he and I would go to New York by stage-coach and return from there to Albany on the Clermont. I think father was particularly desirous of returning home in that way because at the time it was the only steamboat in operation on the globe. A few months previous the Clermont had made her first trip from New York to Albany, a trip which proved that steam navigation had been accomplished notwithstanding a prediction from all classes that a boat could not be propelled by steam. Although others had conceived, Fulton was the first one to realize successfully the utility of steam navigation.
>
> When Cato was informed of the plan of our returning home he was well-nigh frantic, and he said, as near as I can recollect:
>
> > 'Marster Clark, don't you go to New York and git on that new-fangled craf', I 'plore! The steam will blow you and Miss Nancy high up in the tip-top sky. You know we all seen that thing when it first came to Albany, and we didn't like the looks of it - 'ticularly Miss Nancy didn't. You 'member how the black smoke and the red fire was all comin' out of the roof of it. And, 'sides, it did make a dreadful puffin' noise. But - but, Marster Clark, if you are 'termined to go back home that way, please don't take Miss Nancy with you. She can ride the pony and I will walk close 'side of her all the way. A hundred miles won't be much of a walk for me. You see, Marster Clark, if anything should happen to our Miss Nancy, what would me, and you, and Dinah, and - and the chilen, and the rest of us do!'
>
> Poor Cato fell upon his knees, wringing his hands. Then I became somewhat alarmed.
>
> 'If the steamboat should explode!' I tremblingly said.
>
> 'That awful monster will cert'ly splode!' groaned Cato.
>
> My father had no fear. He thought we would reach Albany safely if we took the steamboat, but he was unwilling to give us any anxiety, therefore he said we would return by stage-coach."

"How kind and considerate my grandfather - your father - must have been," said I.

> "Yes, he truly was. He would sacrifice time, comfort, or pleasure if by doing so, he could contribute to the happiness or comfort of others.
>
> Well," continued my mother, "our homeward journey was a delightful one, and our pleasure was greatly enhanced by observing the expression on Cato's face. He sat on my pony with an air of one who had come off victorious in a very important matter. On one occasion he reined up beside the stage-coach, saying:
>
> > 'Marster Clark, this is cert'ly the wise way for us to travel. We'll let the foolish ones travel with that new-fangled steam craf'. You surely know, Marster Clark, that even way back in Bible days, they had both wise and foolish folks, same as we have in these days.'
>
> When we reached home father told me to go at once into the front parlor. What a happy group met me on the doorstep, John, Katharine, Dinah, and our cook! After we had exchanged most hearty greetings, Dinah said to me, 'You are to go right straight alone into the front parlor, my child.'
>
> I noticed, at that moment a peculiar expression on Katharine's and John's faces, an expression which I interpreted as saying, 'We know something that you do not, something delightful.'
>
> As father had told me, when he was assisting me out of the stage-coach, to go directly into that parlor, I surmised it had been furnished with a carpet. When I entered the parlor, I saw no carpet upon the polished floor, but I saw a woman standing in the center of the room. Her face was framed in a quaint cap of rare old lace and silver ribbon.
>
> She came towards me, saying, in a kindly tone:
>
> > 'I wish to tell you something new while we are alone. With your father's consent I arranged to have this interview because I would rather have you hear from me, than from another, what you are to be told. A number of years ago a friend of mine lost her mother. Two years after that sad event, her father married again. My friend's stepmother was a loyal, loving mother to her, while my friend did all she could for the happiness of her stepmother, consequently they lived most happily together. Now I will endeavor to give you all the affection I am capable of giving, and I sincerely pray that you will endeavor to love me, because I am now your father's wife.'
>
> Looking into her face as I did - a face expressive of love and gentleness - I could not but exclaim,
>
> 'I love you already, my new mother!'
>
> We were clasped in each other's arms when father entered the room.
>
> 'The blessing of the Lord rest upon you both' he reverently said while placing one hand upon my new mother's head and one upon mine. And although many years have passed since then, the sweet tone in new mother's low 'Amen,' still reverberates in my memory.
>
> (New mother told me later that it had been her wish to have father inform me of their intended marriage, and also to have me sent for. But as the wedding was to be a very quiet one, my father thought it would not be well to interrupt my studies, as all would be explained to me when I returned from school.)
>
> Well, the time passed most delightfully for us all after my return. Again and again I questioningly said, 'What would we do without new mother!'
>
> She was so thoughtful and sympathetic, and exceedingly kind to my amiable sister, Katharine, and my noble brother, John. Dinah and Cato never found the least fault in her, and to them she was a just mistress as long as they lived. In a word, as had been said of her, 'she followed the precepts as taught by Christ.'
>
> (She was a childless widow when my father married her, and, I may add, very wealthy.)
>
> Then, what added to the happiness of all of us, new mother sent for a kinswoman of hers to spend the winter with us. We soon became greatly attached to the charming Mayritta. She won the hearts of all who became acquainted with her. Truly, it would have been well-nigh impossible not to love her, so winning, affectionate, and refined, the beautiful Mayritta.
>
> She had been with us only a few weeks when she was suddenly taken ill. We wished to send for our physician, J. L Mancius, but new mother preferred the physician employed by a friend of hers.
>
> Mayritta soon became very ill. How I did then wish for our physician, because he had had so much experience! As Mayritta wished me to be with her as much as I possibly could, I had an opportunity of seeing her physician two and three times a day. I was not very favorably impressed with him, and the remedies he prescribed seemed to me to be so simple: only one pill now and then, and a few powders, and I fully realized that Mayritta was getting weaker day by day. I did not like to speak to new mother about changing the physician, or calling in ours for consultation, so I resolved to go to father and explain to him how I felt about the medical treatment Mayritta was receiving.
>
> Why, when one of the pupils at Goshen was ill, her physician gave her very large doses of medicine, not only, but he applied blisters and bled her, too, so as to be sure to cure her. And he did cure her in a very short time. Father thought I was unnecessarily alarmed. He said he had been informed by those who employed Mayritta's physician that they considered him a skillful practitioner, particularly well-equipped from the fact that he had had the benefit of studying under Dr. Hunloke Woodruff, Albany's leading physician. And, furthermore, father said her physician had attended the lectures of the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Rush, at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, which was a great recommendation for a physician at the time.
>
> Well, I returned to Mayritta's room, thinking that my impression of her physician's medical knowledge must have been erroneous, and I regretted that I had expressed my opinion in the matter, because what did I know about the nature of disease, or how, or in what manner or proportion medical aid should be administered?
>
> That night I was to watch by Mayritta's bedside until two o'clock; then my father was to relieve me by taking my place. New mother had had a distressing headache throughout the day, and Dinah had suddenly been called away from home.
>
> The snow had been steadily falling for several hours, and at the gable of the house upon the wide stone ledges beneath the windows the snow lay several inches deep. Mayritta's bed stood directly opposite the windows. The night was fine, and the moon was shining. While I was sitting by Mayritta's bedside, she said faintly:
>
> > 'Nancy, please get me some snow outside of the window, for I feel as if I were burning up.'"

(At the time, fresh air was not admitted into a fever patient's room. The air within the room was kept at a high temperature, the patient usually swathed in flannel, and only warm drinks allowed.)

> "'O Mayritta!' I cried, 'I dare not give you the least bit of snow, for what would your physician say!'
>
> 'Please, please, dear Nancy, give me some,' she most pathetically entreated, 'for I feel as if I were in a furnace of fire.'
>
> I then raised the window a few inches and gathered a small handful of snow.
>
> 'Nancy, this is delicious - so cooling to my parched and burning throat!'
>
> In less than five minutes after, Mayritta begged for more snow. I urged her not to ask for any more, but without avail, for she insisted upon it, so for two hours I gave every few minutes handful after handful of the pure crystal snow, although, while I was doing so, a succession of dreadful forebodings passed through my mind. At two o'clock Mayritta fell asleep. At that hour I was to have awakened father, but I did not dare to make the slightest movement lest I might awaken Mayritta. Besides, father and new mother, too, needed both rest and sleep, for they had watched by Mayritta's bedside every night for a week.
>
> The tall clock on the staircase midlanding struck three - four - five - six. Still Mayritta slept. I was getting to be greatly alarmed. A few minutes after six, Mayritta's physician quietly entered the room.
>
> 'How long has our patient been sleeping like this?' he inquired.
>
> It was not his words, but the tone in which he uttered them that frightened me.
>
> 'She has been sleeping since two o'clock, sir. Do you suppose - oh, I must tell you what I gave her.'
>
> Then I told him all about the snow, and also what wretched hours I had spent, fearing that I had done a great wrong in not resisting her ardent pleadings, however pitiful.
>
> 'Do you consider her worse, sir? And do you believe she is now now going to - to buried my face into the pillow beside the one upon which Mayritta's head was resting.
>
> The physician in a very gentle manner then placed his hands upon my head, and said, in a most reassuring, kindly tone:
>
> > 'No, no, she is not worse, but decidedly better. The crisis is past, I think. She has slept but little for more than a week. Surely this is health restoring sleep. And, Miss Clark, I firmly believe you are the instrument God has made use of for the recovery of my patient. I have painfully realized,' he continued after a pause, 'that our treatment for fever has not produced desired results. We may have kept our patients too warm. Hereafter, I shall adopt the method you unconsciously adopted of having fresh air admitted into the room and cooling drinks administered.'
>
> Mayritta's recovery was a rapid one. Nevertheless, her physician, instead of discontinuing his calls, continued them. It was on this wise: He had ascertained by some means that father and I played chess. And as he, too, understood the game, he had asked and obtained father's permission to spend a couple of hours with me, every now and then, playing that intensely interesting game."

Just at that moment we - mother, sister Marie, and I - heard in the distance the rumble of carriage wheels and merry voices. Several members of the family and their guests were returning from the Delaware Water Gap, whither they had gone three days before. When the party came into view, mother said:

> "I am now obliged to bring this story of my early life to a hasty conclusion. I shall have time, however, to tell you what you already know, namely, with the sanction, not only, but with the hearty approval of my father and new mother, Dr. Jacob Lansing Van Deusen - Mayritta's physician - and I were married, married on the twenty-sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and eight.
>
> And on our happy, happy wedding day, when a white lace cap - worn by married women at the time - was put upon my head, I said, and could unreservedly say, 'Truly delightful were the days of my girlhood.'"

NOTE: The elements of a fine character, which had been very apparent during the childhood and girlhood of Nancy S. Clark, were strongly marked and fully developed in her womanhood. She was endowed with an exceptional balance and strength of mind, and she possessed a gracious charm of manner, which distinguished her as a true gentlewoman. While she looked "well to the ways of her household," outside claims were not neglected. As there was no Episcopal Church in Montague, she connected herself with the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church -- the church of her husband and of his ancestors - and she was thoroughly loyal to it. She was also in hearty sympathy with her husband in his ministration for the alleviation of human suffering. Many and many a poor mother with a sick babe wrapped in her arms rapped at their door, feeling assured that even if the doctor were not at home, his wife, enriched with the experience she had acquired in ministering to her own little ones, would do all she possibly could to relieve, even if she could not cure, the suffering one. And not that only, but rarely did such an applicant ever recross her threshold without being tenderly entreated by her, in a few words, to seek help also, for both body and soul, of the Great Physician. Her trust in the heavenly Father's love and care was strong and abiding. Her sincere but unostentatious piety seemed to envelop her like a clinging garment -

> As some rare perfume in a vase of clay  
> Pervades it with a fragrance not its own,  
> So where Thou dwellest in a mortal soul,  
> All Heaven's own sweetness seems 'round it thrown.

Katharine Clark, the beautiful, saintly Katharine, was called up higher when in the thirty-fifth year of her age, leaving a devoted husband, Dorepheus Abbey, and three remarkably interesting children, Amelia, Arabella, Clark.

True, the call came early to Katharine, but the sheaf was ready to be garnered.

John Clark, when in his twenty-first year, was an officer on the war vessel "Scorpion," during the time that vessel took an active part in the naval engagement between the Americans and the British on Lake Erie, 10th of September, 1813. After that engagement, Commander Oliver Hazard Perry sent a letter to the father of the young officer, of which the following is a portion:

> ...Your son, John Clark, was buried on Edwards Island. His grave is with those of the other officers who fell in the action on the 10th of September. Your son behaved as became a brave officer, and he fell at his post supporting his country's honor. He, no doubt, had he lived, would have been an honor to his friends and his country. I sympathize most deeply with you in your great loss.
>
> Your humble ob't. servant,
>
> <p style="text-align:center">O. H. PERRY</p>

(After that battle, the bodies of the slain, except the officers, Claxton, Clark, and Lamb, were wrapped in rude shrouds and committed to the deep.

The officers were buried on the margin of South Bass or Edwards Island, in Lake Erie. Congress at the time presented a finely enchased sword to the nearest male relative of Claxton, Clark, and Lamb. John Clark's sword and also the letter of Oliver Hazard Perry, are treasured heirlooms in the Van Deusen family.)

Jacob Lansing Van Deusen, in the year 1806, received his medical diploma from the hand of his kinsman, Chancellor John Lansing, Jr., of Albany, N.Y. When presenting the diploma, the Chancellor said: "Jacob Lansing, I have now made a doctor of medicine of you, and 1 sincerely trust that you will be an honor to the profession."

That admonition was well remembered by the Doctor, and his career attested how faithfully he treasured and acted upon that golden word "in season."

The Doctor commenced his practice in Albany, 1806. He also held the commission of surgeon to a regiment of artillery stationed there. He remained in Albany until 1816. His health then became somewhat impaired. His associates, Drs. Stearns and Willard, advised him to go where a country practice would compel exercise and healthful exposure. Acting upon their advice, and at the earnest solicitation of his friends, General and James Wadsworth, whose views coincided with those of Drs. Stearns and Willard, the Doctor left Albany and removed to Geneseo, N. Y. During the time the Doctor remained in Geneseo, General and James Wadsworth manifested their appreciation of the Doctor's services by presenting to him many valuable gifts.

The Doctor made one more removal. It was on this wise: Roger Clark died in the year 1817 - he was a lawyer by profession. Having no children, he bequeathed his estate, situated on the picturesque banks of the Delaware River, at Montague, New Jersey, to his nephew, Sanford Clark, who in the meantime had removed from Albany to Montague.

Sanford Clark and his wife wished to have their daughters, Nancy and Katharine, near them in their declining years. Katharine and her family had been with them for some time.

In obedience to their wishes, the Doctor and his family left Geneseo in the year 1820 and settled permanently at Montague, and there the Doctor continued in active practice forty years.

To his profession he was zealously devoted, a profession he had chosen when a lad of thirteen years, while he was with his parents, Jacob and Elsie Lansing Van Deusen - his parents to whom he ever referred with deep affection, and of their having left to their descendants the inestimable legacy of well-spent lives.

Dr. and Mrs. Jacob Lansing Van Deusen had the honor of celebrating their golden wedding. And a few years after that joyous event, having well served their generation, they triumphantly "entered in through the gates into the city," to go no more out for ever.

Their children: Arabella, Helen, John Clark, Jacob Billings, Elizabeth, Sanford, Columbus, Abram Lansing, George Nelden, Anna Marie, James Lansing, Alida Lansing, Sara Ann, Orlando.
